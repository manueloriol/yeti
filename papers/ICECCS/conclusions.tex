\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
This article presented the .NET binding of YETI. The binding allows YETI to 
test .NET programs in an automated and random way. It is the first random system 
to interpret failures of code contracts in a correct way automatically.

On .NET code, YETI runs with unparalleled speed --Êaround $10^{6}$ 
calls in 3 minutes on fast code -- to date and 
provides a graphical user interface that allows test engineers to
diagnose what happens while testing and thus be able to change 
parameters used in the testing session while it proceeds.

To validate our approach we used YETI on code in which we seeded bugs and showed that
we were able to find 77\% of the seeded bugs. This allowed us to identify some types of bugs 
that YETI cannot find in .NET. We also tested core .NET libraries and showed 
some limitations of YETI.

Future work will fix a couple of issues found through experiments. In particular, 
we plan to enrich YETI with an automated parser for documentation in order to help 
with the automated identifications of bugs.
