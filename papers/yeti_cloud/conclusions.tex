\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
In this article, we introduced a cloud version of the York 
Extensible Testing Infrastructure (YETI). YETI is a langage 
agnostic random testing tool for which the reference 
implementation tests Java programs. 

The cloud implementation of YETI allows to solve performances 
issue when testing large programs. It also allows
to perform testing on clean Virtual Machines, solving potential 
security issues. We performed limited experiments to validate 
our approach.
