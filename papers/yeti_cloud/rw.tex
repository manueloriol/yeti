Distributing software testing over multiple computers has received very little attention in the research community. Some of the efforts resulted in tools like Joshua %~\cite{Kapfhammer},% 
which uses Jini for distributing the execution of a regression test suite across a number of CPUs and writes the results back to a centralised repository; and 
GridUnit %~\cite{Duarte1, Duarte2}% 
which employs a computational Grid to speed up the testing process. A single master distributes test cases for execution across machines in a Grid and then waits for the results.
Both these approaches extend the JUnit testing framework and the test cases have to be manualy created beforehand.
