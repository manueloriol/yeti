The York Extensible Testing Infrastructure (YETI) is an automated random 
testing tool that allows to test programs written in various programming 
languages.
While YETI is one of the fastest random testing tools with over a million 
method calls per minute on fast code, testing large programs or slow code 
 --Ê such as libraries using intensively the memory --  might benefit from parallel 
executions of testing sessions. 
This paper presents the cloud-enabled version of YETI. It relies on the Hadoop 
package and its map/reduce implementation to distribute tasks over potentially 
many computers.
This would allow to distribute the cloud version of YETI over Amazon's Elastic 
Compute Cloud (EC2).
