\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
This article presents YETI, a new tool to run automated random testing 
sessions of Java programs. YETI runs at a very high speed -- around $10^{6}$ calls per 
minute on fast code -- and provides a graphical user interface that allows test engineers to
diagnose the testing process while testing. Test engineers are then able to 
change parameters and types used in the testing session while it proceeds.
To validate our approach we used YETI on \texttt{java.lang} and on a package
of a popular open source library. YETI found 45 faults in 
\texttt{java.lang} and 120 in the open source library.

Future work will further focus on visualising better the result of the testing process 
by presenting intuitive representations of the failure domains.
