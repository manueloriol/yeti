\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

To evaluate the performances of our approach, we first evaluate its  raw speed with a test class. We also ran two series of tests: we first tested all classes in \texttt{java.lang} $10^{6}$ times each. We also tested a package from iText\footnote{http://www.lowagie.com/iText/ downloaded Sep. 1, 2009} a well known library -- 1,969,220 downloads on SourceForge\footnote{http://sourceforge.net/projects/itext/}, $84\%$ positive advices, activity of $99.85\%$ -- for manipulating PDF documents in Java. 

All tests were run using a MacBook Pro 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB of 1067 MHz DDR3 of RAM, under MacOSX with the Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0\_15-b03-219) -- with default value of 64MB of RAM reserved. 

\subsection{Performances}

We tested the following piece of code using YETI:
\begin{verbatim}
public class Perf{
        int i=0;
        public void test(){
                i++;
        }
}
\end{verbatim}

A million tests were performed in 35 seconds. The same code called one million times from the actual code is executing 1000 times faster because it does not perform the calls through the reflective layer.

Another potential performance issue is the overhead incurred by the GUI.
In order for the graphical interface not to slow down the testing process, we use two threads.
The first one samples data for building graphs every .1 seconds, the second one updates the graphical user interfaces and waits .1 second between two updates. A special care has also been taken for not showing all samples in the graphs when not needed: we only show one point per pixel on the x-axis. In ten minutes testing sessions  of \texttt{java.lang.String} on a dual core MacBook Pro, the slowdown incurred by the GUI was $4.4\%$. 

%(see Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} for a further evaluation of the performances of the GUI). 


%To test raw performances of YETI, we made two small classes -- \texttt{Perf} and \texttt{Perf1} shown in Figure~\ref{fig:perf} -- that we tested 30 times each with one million tests. Results are presented in Figures~\ref{fig:perfDriver} and~\ref{fig:perfValue}.

%public class Perf{
%        int i=0;
%        public void test(){
%                i++;
%        }
%}
%public class Perf1{
%        public void test(int i){
%                int j = i;
%                i++;
%                assert(i>j);
%        }
%}
%\end{verbatim}
%}

%\end{figure}
%
%While \texttt{Perf} does not exhibit failures, \texttt{Perf1} exhibits failures when \texttt{i} is equal to \texttt{MAX\_INT} if assertions are enabled (which we chose to do in this test).

%\end{figure}

%To make sure that we only tested the overhead of the infrastructure, we also made one million calls on each of the methods from another program. Figure~\ref{fig:perfDriver} shows box and whisker plots for the two raw tests.

%\end{figure}
%
%Figure~\ref{fig:perfValue} shows box and whisker plots for 30 YETI testing sessions of one million tests made on \texttt{Perf} and \texttt{Perf1}, both with and without the GUI. 
%
%We can see that there is a slowdown of more than a factor 1000 over the direct invocation. The GUI also incurs respectively a $5.5\%$ and $8.1\%$ overhead.
%
%Eventually, even over long running sessions (when logs are not stored within YETI) the number of routine calls effected, grows linearly with time as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:string} for a 50 minute session testing \texttt{java.lang.String}.

We tested all classes in \texttt{java.lang} with YETI. For each class we requested $1,000,000$ tests. Except for a couple of classes that were too memory intensive -- such as \texttt{StringBuffer} -- that we tested with $100,000$ tests only.
Table~\ref{tab:javalang} shows our results. The first column of numbers indicates the total number of
throwables that the tests triggered. We then classified each throwable as either a fault or not. This takes into account that programmers do not necessarily declare runtime exceptions but rather indicate them in the documentation. For throwables that where not ruled out, 
we then classify them by column. Note that the documentation of certain classes states up front that
some kind of exceptions are to be expected -- for example \texttt{NullPointerException} in \texttt{String}.
Other classes declare all runtime exceptions. This indicates that several teams actually collaborated to make this API. 

The small number of faults other than \texttt{NullPointerException}s, shows the overall quality of \texttt{java.lang} in terms of API and implementation. Most exceptions seem indeed to be omitted in the documentation rather than real bugs in the system.

It is however compelling to see that YETI can actually uncover 45 faults in a library as used and tested as \texttt{java.lang}. 
While these faults are real, it is to be noted that we only uncover runtime faults (runtime exceptions and errors) and it has no knowledge of methods that should be called in specific orders.
Faults resulting from the misuse of such methods are still reported as faults by the tool.
To obtain more data to assess how useful YETI would be for regular developers, we present similar results for a regular open source project in the next section.

In order to have a more representative project for end-users, we tested the package \texttt{com.lowagie.text} from iText. Table~\ref{tab:comlowagietext} shows the aggregated results of the tests. Because this package is time intensive to test, we decided to test all classes in the package at the same time for only a $100000$ tests. The testing session lasted for 15 minutes and output 138 unique failures. Comparatively to the previous tests, the code almost did not declare any runtime exception. Only five classes --~\texttt{Cell}, \texttt{MarkedSection}, \texttt{Phrase}, \texttt{RectangleReadOnly}, and \texttt{Section}~-- did it in an informal way. 

It is worth noting that two classes --~\texttt{RectangleReadOnly}  and \texttt{Document}~-- exhibit a high number of project-defined errors. We investigated and found out that these two classes have poor documentation rather than poor code. This is to be expected in a free open source project as the code often serves as documentation.
