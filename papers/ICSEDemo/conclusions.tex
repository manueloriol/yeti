\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
This demo presents YETI, a tool to run automated random testing 
sessions on potentially multiple programming languages. The current  reference 
implementation works on Java but other bindings exist for JML and 
.NET. 

YETI is the latest in a family of recent random testing tools like
JCrasher~\cite{Csallner2004}, Jartege~\cite{Oriat2004}, Jtest~\cite{Jtest}, and in particular 
AutoTest~\cite{Ciupa2007}. YETI is however 
different from these tools in at least two important ways: (1) it is made to 
easily support multiple programming languages and (2) 
it is intended to allow test engineers to modify the parameters of the 
testing during the testing session itself.
