This demo presents the York Extensible Testing Infrastructure (YETI), a random testing tool for programs written in Java, .NET, JML... We focus on how to test Java code using YETI. The tool runs at a high level of performances with $10^6$ calls per minute on Java code. It benefits from a graphical user interface and allows testers to interact with the testing process in real-time. This is useful to abort or modify the parameters of the testing session when needed.
