\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
This article presented YETI, a new tool to run automated random testing 
sessions on multiple programming languages. The current  reference 
implementation works on Java but other bindings exist for JML and 
for .NET. 

On Java code, YETI runs with unparalleled speed --Êaround $10^{6}$ 
calls per minute on fast code -- to date and 
provides a graphical user interface that allows test engineers to
diagnose what happens while testing and thus be able to change 
parameters and types used in the testing session while it proceeds.

To validate our approach we used YETI on \texttt{java.lang} and on a package
of a popular open source library. This lead to exhibit 45 faults in 
\texttt{java.lang} and 120 in the open source library.

Future work will focus on bringing more languages into YETI and improve further
its interface as well as its strategies.
