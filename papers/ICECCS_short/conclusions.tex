\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
This article presented the .NET binding of YETI. The binding allows YETI to 
test .NET programs in an automated and random way. It is the first random system 
to interpret failures of code contracts in a correct way automatically.

To validate our approach we used YETI on code in which we seeded bugs and showed that
we were able to find 77\% of the seeded bugs. This allowed us to identify some types of bugs 
that YETI cannot find in .NET. 

Future work will focus on enriching YETI with an automated parser for documentation in order to help 
with the automated identifications of bugs.
