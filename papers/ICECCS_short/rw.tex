%With programs becoming increasingly complex, the process of testing 
%them has to become smarter and more efficient. Automated random testing
%is a technique that is cheap to run and proved to find bugs in Java libraries and 
%programs~\cite{Pacheco2005,Csallner2004}, in Haskell 
%programs~\cite{Claessen00quickcheck:a}.

YETI is the latest in a serie of recent random testing tools like
JCrasher~\cite{Csallner2004}, Jartege~\cite{Oriat2004},
Eclat~\cite{Pacheco2005}, or
%Jtest~\cite{Jtest}, or
% RUTE-J~\cite{Andrews2006a}, particular 
AutoTest~\cite{CPLOM:08:PRTOOS}. 
YETI is however 
different from these tools in at least three important ways: (1) it is made to 
easily support multiple programming languages, (2) 
it is intended to allow test engineers to modify the parameters of the 
testing during the testing session itself, and (3) it is at least 3 orders 
of magnitude faster than competing tools. 

%The first characteristics comes from
%the meta-model that YETI uses that is not bound to a specific paradigm.
%It also implies that some domain-specific optimizations~\cite{Pacheco2007,Godefroid2005,Chen2004a,Chen2005} will not be possible 
%without additional support because YETI does not know values or language-specific
%constructs. 

%The second point is the truly innovative point. All other approaches
%considered the testing tool to be a component that would run by itself without 
%further interactions. In our experience the runtime monitoring has become 
%the main means of knowing how the testing session evolves and possibly to 
%improve it by modifying some parameters. 

%To illustrate the last point, Randoop~\cite{1390643} produced 4 millions test of .NET 
%programs in 150 hours. While the intent is a bit different because we do not use 
%feedback to generate test cases, it takes around 12mn to perform the same amount of method 
%calls on .NET programs in YETI -- in an admittedly uncontrolled way. Further 
%evaluations should be conducted to compare effectiveness of both approaches.

The .NET binding of YETI is however the first random testing tool to interpret correctly 
code-contracts violations and to leverage on that to filter bugs.
