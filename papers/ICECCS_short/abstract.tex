Testing code is one of the central techniques for quality assessment of code. Generating 
test cases manually, however, is costly and inherently biased by the human point of view. While 
this might not be an issue for end-user code, it is problematic for developing libraries. 

The York Extendible Testing Infrastructure (YETI) is an automated random testing infrastructure
supporting multiple programming languages (Java, JML, and .NET). It tests code at random and 
decouples the engine from the strategies and the language used. This article presents
the .NET binding.
